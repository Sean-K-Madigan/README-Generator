  # README Generator
  

  ## Project Description
  
  The goal of this project is to create a javascript program that can be run locally via node.js. This program will prompt the user for information and use that information to create a professional README.md file. This program allows the developer to spend significanly less time formatting and writing their README file. The development of this program allowed me to learn how to use JavaScript locally with the Node.js program to prompt the user for command line input and write files directly from the command line information.
